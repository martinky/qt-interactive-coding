/**
    \class qicRuntime
    The qicRuntime class provides the runtime build and execution environment.

    The exec() method takes a piece of self-contained C++ source code, wraps it
    in a shared library `qmake` project and builds it using the installed C++
    toolchain and Qt SDK. The source code must define and export the
    qic_entry() function. Upon successful compilation of this code into a
    shared library, this library is loaded, and the qic_entry() function is
    resolved and called.

    The ctx() method returns the qicContext object for exchange of data with
    the runtime-compiled code.

    Use the various setters to control the build environment. You can override
    environment variables, path to the `qmake` and `make` programs, add defines,
    include paths and linked libraries. By default, the compiled library does
    not link with Qt. You can override and link with Qt libraries using
    setQtLibs(). Use setQtConfig() to configure additional build options.

    \fn qicRuntime::qicRuntime()
    Constructs a default build and runtime environment. Environment variables
    are inherited from the parent process. The `qmake` and `make` (or `nmake`
    on Windows) utilities are expected to be on PATH.

    \fn qicRuntime::~qicRuntime()
    Destroys the runtime environment. Destroys all objects registered by the
    runtime-compiled code via qicContext::set() and unloads all libraries in
    reverse order.

    \fn qicRuntime::exec()
    Compiles and executes the provided C++ code. This method is blocking and
    returns only after the build process completes and the qic_entry() function
    returns.

    \fn qicRuntime::execFile()
    Same as exec() except the source code is read from the \a filename;

    \fn qicRuntime::setEnv()
    Sets an environment variable for the build process.

    \fn qicRuntime::addEnv()
    Appends an environment variable, using the system's native path delimiter.
    Useful for appending the PATH env variable.

    \fn qicRuntime::loadEnv()
    Sets one or more environment variables loaded from a file. Useful for
    configuring a complete build environment.

    \fn qicRuntime::setQmake()
    Sets the path to the `qmake` utility. Useful when multiple installations
    of the Qt SDK are present.

    \fn qicRuntime::setMake()
    Sets the path to the `make` utility, or `nmake` on Windows.

    \fn qicRuntime::setDefines()
    Sets the content of the **DEFINES** `qmake` variable.

    \fn qicRuntime::setIncludePath()
    Sets the content of the **INCLUDEPATH** `qmake` variable.

    \fn qicRuntime::setLibs()
    Sets the content of the **LIBS** `qmake` variable.

    \fn qicRuntime::setQtLibs()
    Sets the content of the **QT** `qmake` variable. This controls which Qt
    libraries will be linked with the binary. By default Qt is not linked.

    \fn qicRuntime::setQtConfig()
    Sets the content of the **CONFIG** `qmake` variable. This is used to
    control build options such as debug/release, rtti, exceptions, etc. If the
    host application is compiled using `CONFIG=debug`, make sure, the runtime
    code is also compiled with the same option. Otherwise the host application
    and the runtime code will be linked with different Qt libraries and
    different versions of the CRT runtime which will cause unpredictable fatal
    errors.

    \fn qicRuntime::setOutputTo()
    Directs the output of the build process to the given \a device. This can be
    used to record the output and display it through a GUI, for example. To
    completely discard the output, set this to `nullptr`.

    \fn qicRuntime::setOutputToStdOut()
    Directs the output of the build process to the standard output. This is the
    default behavior.

    \fn qicRuntime::ctx()
    Returns pointer to qicContext that can be used to share data with the
    runtime code.
